# README.md

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the HoloLens 2 application developed for the [HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy). This application allows a user to map their surroundings and drive a holographic remote controlled car. The application uses the HoloLens 2's spatial mapping capabilities to create a 3D mesh of the environment. The user can then place the car on the mesh and drive it around using a holographic remote control.

## Users

### 1. Students and Educators

Students (ages 13 or older) and educators can use the project as an educational tool to learn about augmented reality, spatial computing, and robotics.

### 2. General Consumers

General consumers who are interested in exploring new and immersive experiences offered by mixed reality technology can benefit from the project.

### 3. Unity Developers

Developers interested in learning Unity development for mixed reality applications may find value in the project's codebase, experimenting with new features, or contributing to its development.

### 4. HoloLens Developers

HoloLens developers may see the project as a source of inspiration or reference for incorporating spatial mapping, hand tracking, and other HoloLens features into their own projects.

### Warning

Potential HoloLens users should cross-reference Microsoftâ€™s Product Safety Warnings and Instructions to ensure that they are safely using the product.
